# Definition of done

A feature is defined as done and ready for a PR into main only once it has been properly tested. Testing consists of:

1. Unit-tests to test the basic functionality 
2. Integration testing to ensure all features work together
3. Passing the CI/CD

Unit-testing and ingegration testing are done using the [testthat]() framework. New features usually, but no always require new tests.

If you are developing, for example a new statistical function for chefStats then it must be checked with unit tests.

Additionally, all previous unit-tests and integration tests need to pass. You can check this by running `devtools::test()` in the respective packages.

__Note:__ Integration testing mostly resides in the ramnog package, so you will need to run `devtools::test()` there as well
