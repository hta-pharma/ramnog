The {ramnog} ecosystem incl. {chef}, {chefStats}, and {chefCriteria} is developed in a collaborative manner. 
This vignette describes the git actions and pre-commit hooks that are used to ensure a consistent and high-quality codebase.

The github actions are run on every push to the main branch and on every pull request. The pre-commit hooks are run on every commit.
**NB**. the pre-commit hooks are only run if the pre-commit package is installed. These checks are run locally on the developer's machine.

The configuration for both Git-Actions as well as pre-commit hooks is stored in the ramnog repository and consumed by the remainder of the ecosystem.

## Git Actions

## Pre-commit hooks

Individual setup of pre-commit hooks is described in the [pre-commit documentation](https://pre-commit.com/).

__Quick Start__:
```
# Install pre-commit in the Individual user space (use pip if pipx is not installed)
pipx install pre-commit 
# Install the pre-commit hooks in the repository NB this needs to be run in the root of the repository
pre-commit install 
# Run on all files to check it works:
pre-commit run --all-files 
```
